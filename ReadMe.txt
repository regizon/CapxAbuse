1. Unpack folder with chromedriver in folder of your project

2. Make "pip install selenium" in your terminal.

3. Add your main invite code in "invite_codes.txt"

4. After work of soft you will see new codes in invites.txt, you need to add them in the "invite_codes.txt" ( this will make second circle of your referals )

P.S. if you want, you can turn on headless mode but this can call errors in work of programm, all you need to do:

open "main.py" in any code redactor;

find string "#options.add("--headless")";

erase char "#" from the front of the string.
